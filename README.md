# ABS-ACT-public-data
This public repository contains the analysis products (public) but not the results (public when the paper goes on arxiv).

Planck half-mission 143 GHz maps are frequency maps from the 2015 data release, downloaded from the [Planck Legacy Archive](https://pla.esac.esa.int/#home), rotated to equatorial and harmonically reprojected to `nside 256`. 

ABS maps and masks are from Kusaka et al. 2018 from [Lambda](https://lambda.gsfc.nasa.gov/product/abs/abs_prod_table.cfm).
